The dashboard is designed to facilitate data-driven decision-making by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and shipment analysis.


## Objectives

* Sales Analysis: Track overall sales performance, including YoY growth, sales margin, and monthly sales comparison.

* Customer Analysis: Understand customer lifetime value, sales volume, retention rates, and customer segmentation.

* Product Analysis: Evaluate product performance, profitability, and popularity over time.

* Late Shipments Analysis: Identify trends and causes of late shipments, segmented by product, customer, and region.

* Sales Rep Analysis: Measure sales reps' performance, efficiency, and impact on sales growth.
